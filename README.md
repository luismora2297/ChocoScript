# ChocoScript

Hi, the reason what this repository was created is because i wanted to share some of my custom functions of Javascript, ECMAscript and Jquery, more like a compilation library for people that could have the same troubles as i have working on some pages and make some troubles more easy to resolve, the license is MPL V 2.0 because it has to be free for everyone, free of personal use and everything!

# Notes :godmode:

Remember to use Jquery because some functions are using Jquery or written on that Syntax!

I don't really mind if you use it for other things, or say that you created it, but please, give some credits man! :goberserk:

Besides, it's really useful for some stuff, please credit if you want to BlackBohr :smiley:
